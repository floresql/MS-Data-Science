Extremely well-maintained. Bought as a certified used Mercedes. Adult owned never dragged or raced. I added a fully reversible Eurocharge stage 1 tune that bumps the torque from 479ft/lbs to an amazing 638ft/lbs which truly unleashes the beast in this vehicle. You‚Äôre in for a brutal and exhilarating acceleration. If you prefer it without the tune I can reverse it for you at no cost. I just installed brand new OEM Michelin tires in the rear with less than 15 miles on them. Original manual and two keys.Fully loaded. MSRP 144k. Driven less than 100 miles per month.

Reviews:  * Shop here if you need your SUV to carry up to eight passengers all of their stuff and tow up to 8300 pounds. Not only can you do all that but youll look good while doing it. Source: KBB.com  * Available seating for up to eight passengers; strong V8 power; stout towing capacity; quiet interior. Source: Edmunds  * The well-recognized Escalade has been among the Kings of the SUV family for years. For 2015 the much loved SUV has been revamped and upgraded. The classic eye-catching look of the Escalade remains unchanged riding high on it's traditional body-frame. But for some it's on what's on the inside that counts. The all new interior is wrapped in a wealth of perforated leather prominent stitching and genuine wood while tiered surfaces demonstrate a level of detail and craftsmanship unmatched in previous generations. The dash and instrument panel are anchored by the flashy CUE multimedia system and its 8-inch touchscreen interface. CUE uses proximity sensors to activate common options and controls as the user's hand approaches. Opt for the larger 12.3in and embrace the HD graphics. The front and rear ends use steeply stacked vertical layouts for the standard LED headlights and taillights and Cadillac's grille design is presented in its largest form yet. The Escalade also carries over a 6.2-liter V8 this one comes from the latest generation of direct-injection engines with output increased to 420HP and 460 lb-ft of torque. This combination combusts in a freight train-like pull when you hit the throttle. The base rear-wheel-drive Escalade can tow up to 8200 pounds  making it useful for those who aren't afraid to get a little dirty. Escalade's new technologies include safety features to help protect occupants at all times; front and rear automatic braking relies short-range radar technology and ultrasonic sensors to help avoid front and rear low-speed collisions. Driver Awareness packages include Forward Collision Alert Lane Departure Warning System and the patented Safety Alert Seat which uses directional vibrations to alert the driver to potential crash threats.

Onyx Black 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 SLE RWD 6-Speed Automatic Electronic with Overdrive EcoTec3 4.3L V6 Flex Fuel  Awards:   * 2014 KBB.com Brand Image Awards Come see your friends today at Patriot CDJR in McAlester, OK! Visit our online showroom at   today!  Reviews:   * New, more fuel-efficient engines; improved interior; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 Sierras innovative powertrains and handsome aesthetics should appeal to longtime GMC fans and tempt buyers new to the brand. In just one of many mine is bigger battles in the half-ton truck market, the 2014 Sierras 12,000-pound max tow rating is expected to be king  at least for now. Source: KBB.com   * The 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 is all new for 2014. It possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. Open the doors and the Sierra's interior welcomes you into a calming and comfortable retreat from the busy outside world. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs, which are more convenient to grab. Spoil yourself with the available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims. It lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Base Level Sierra trims on all models come with a powerful 4.3-Liter V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes. Plus, since you have the choice between two to three trims based on the model picked, GMC has a 2014 Sierra 1500 for just about anyone.

Body is in exceptional condition with no rust, no major dents, scratches or dings, and the paint has a high gloss shine; interior is impeccably clean with no stains, no odors, no rips or tears, no smoking, and no excess wear; alloy wheels are in like new condition with no pitting or peeling.  I will try to make the explanation of the service history as simple as possible. Since the time this car was new, it has been serviced at the Subaru Dealer, and serviced exactly as recommended by Subaru. Every minor and major service has been done, spot on, with absolutely no services skipped or missed and absolutely no gaps in the service history. You will not find a more thorough service history, and I have the entire 21 page service history from the local Subaru Dealer to go with the car.  It has been serviced a total of 34 times, which means that the car has been serviced an average of every 2,100 miles since new. (Subaru recommends service on this car every 3,750 miles). Vehicle was just serviced at the Subaru Dealer about 600 miles ago and got everything that they recommended, which included a new muffler, wiper blades, full synthetic oil change and VT State Inspection, which is now good though 12/31/21. This Forester also got new front brakes about 3,000 miles ago, and new spark plugs as part of the 60k mile major service, which was completed less than 10k miles ago.  Additionally, the car has 4 like new Nokian Hakkapeliitta R3 winter tires on it now. Starting in 2011, Subaru started using the updated triple layer steel head gaskets that never require replacement, and they switched the engine design from a timing belt to a timing chain, which has no recommended maintenance or replacement. This Forester runs and drives great, no ""problem lights"" on, vehicle has great power, shifts smoothly, sounds and feels tight over bumps, goes down the road straight with no shaking or pulling, brake pedal is high and tight with no shaking or squeaking, interior cabin is very quiet even at highway speeds, ride is very smooth, all options work, everything is very tight, and fuel economy is excellent for an all wheel drive vehicle. Clean title in hand, clean Carfax report, 1 owner, and no accidents.  Vehicle comes with all 3 original keys; two keys with built in buttons for factory alarm/keyless entry/panic/trunk release, plus a valet key, and the owner's manual and all related literature in the original Subaru leather pouch. This Forester is priced $1,000 below NADA retail or ""high book value,"" and it goes well beyond meeting the description of what a vehicle should be, condition wise and mechanically, to deserve high book value; price is currently firm. This car is truly the exception to the rule condition-wise.  If you put this car in a showroom and put the original window sticker back in it, most folks walking by wouldn't even notice that it wasn't new.  Current odometer reading is 70,678.
